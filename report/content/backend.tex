\section{MAS Traffic Simulator Backend}\label{sec:backend}

TODO write backend-section

% no timestepping but rather timestamping (event-based)
% Car Agent types be LOCAL, SEMI_LOCAL, GLOBAL
% respective type of information available / being queried from planner-agent

% Public transit is due to complexity of formal representation of timetables not done.

% NOTE: persisted info of sim run (logging info etc.) will be covered in detail in frontend (as this is basically what's being displayed and red from NodeJS app). This `Backend` section needed to describe which parts of the agents save which of their information, but no detail regarding how these are being put together later need be explained here just now.
