# Traffic Simulation based on Real-Time Information

## Task description:

Supporting travelers with *real-time information*  (RTI) has become a proven technology in providing
passengers with optimal routes. Classically, RTI has been used by transit providers for operations and
control purposes. More recently, RTI is increasingly available to travelers on public (e.g., signage at
stops) and private transport systems (e.g., traffic information based on crowdsourced data).
In this work, we are interested in simulating the dynamic movements and interaction of distributed
entities. To this end, we might implement an agent-based system that consist of several travelers that
have a given origin and destination in a network that might be specified by a graph. For reaching their
destination, the travelers might make use of private vehicles (and / or public transport that follows
certain timetables). The different modes of transport might be modeled by different types of transport
agents. Furthermore, planning agents might be responsible for providing the travelers with a set of
alternative travel options. In this work, random events that change the state of the network might occur
(e.g., breakdowns) and the travel times might depend on the density of the traffic flow (e.g., congestion
slowing down traffic). As a result, travel agents might be in a dynamic relationship with planning agents,
such that, when the expected travel times change, a reaction is possible by updating the route. In this
case, it might be necessary to divert the travelers such that the congestion is overcome without relocating
the congestion to different paths of the network.

## Main tasks:

- Build a simulation platform, where agents consider the shortest path between their origin and destination based on the current state of the network (a visualization is highly recommended).
    - At each vertex, following the dynamics of the network, agents might check if a better path is available.
    - Here, we might differentiate between fully and partially observable environments.
- Identify meaningful measures for evaluating the state of the traffic in the system (e.g., difference between expected and actual travel time).
- We might analyze different types of planning agents and different graphs.
- Finally, we might examine the resilience of the system to stochastic events that lead to a reduction in capacity of an edge / arc (e.g., accidents or breakdowns).
